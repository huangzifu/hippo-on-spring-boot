# hippo-on-spring-boot

**hippo-on-spring-boot**, a demo project to wrap a Hippo project into single JAR executable Spring Boot application.

This project uses [hipshoot Spring Boot Support library](http://hipshoot.forge.onehippo.org/hipshoot-spring-boot-support/index.html)
to wrap a Hippo project into a Spring Boot application package.

In summary,
- This demo project was simply generated by following [Getting Started with Hippo CMS](https://www.onehippo.org/trails/getting-started/hippo-essentials-getting-started.html).
- Simply added some built-in example features using Essentials such as News, Events, etc.
- Added [spring-boot-deploy](spring-boot-deploy/) Maven submodule which lets us wrap Hippo project into single JAR executable Spring Boot application
  by following [hipshoot Spring Boot Support library](http://hipshoot.forge.onehippo.org/hipshoot-spring-boot-support/index.html).
- Added [test.sh](spring-boot-deploy/test.sh) and [test.bat](spring-boot-deploy/test.bat) to show how to execute the single executable JAR.
- That's it.

## Build

```bash
    $ mvn clean package
```

## Run

```bash
    $ cd spring-boot-deploy
    $ ./test.sh
```

Or, on Windows,

```bash
    > cd spring-boot-deploy
    > test.bat
```


See [test.sh](spring-boot-deploy/test.sh) or [test.bat](spring-boot-deploy/test.bat).
It's just a simple ```java``` command line.


You can simply type Ctrl-C to stop it.

## Test

Visit [http://localhost:8080/site/](http://localhost:8080/site/) and
[http://localhost:8080/cms/](http://localhost:8080/cms/).

## Default Application Configuration

See [application.yaml](spring-boot-deploy/src/main/resources/application.yaml).

## Deploying to the cloud (e.g, Cloud Foundry, Heroku, etc.)

See [Deploying to the cloud](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/cloud-deployment.html) in Spring Boot documentation for detail.

You could use a very simple command like this when deploying onto Cloud Foundry, for example:

    cd spring-boot-deploy
    cf push hippo-on-spring-boot -p target/hippo-on-spring-boot-spring-boot-deploy-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -m 2G -t 180
